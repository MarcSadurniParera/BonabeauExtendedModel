# Emergence of social hierarchies in a society with two competitive groups

## Abstract
Agent-based models describing social interactions among individuals can help to better understand 
emerging macroscopic patterns in societies. One of the topics which is worth tackling is the formation 
of different kinds of hierarchies that emerge in social spaces such as cities. Here we propose 
a Bonabeau-like model by adding a second group of agents. The fundamental particularity of our model 
is that only a pairwise interaction between agents of the opposite group is allowed. Agent fitness can 
thus only change by competition among the two groups, while the total fitness in the society remains 
constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the model parameters, the fitness of 
the agents of each group show a decay in time except for one or very few agents which capture almost 
all the fitness in the society. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian 
to hierarchical society for each group. This behaviour depends on the control parameter ùúÇ, playing the 
role of the inverse of the temperature of the system. Results are invariant with regard to the system 
size, contingent solely on the quantity of agents within each group. Finally, scaling laws are provided 
thus showing a data collapse from different model parameters and they follow a shape which can be related 
to the presence of a phase transition in the model.

### Prerequisites

Instal Fortran 90, Gnuplot and Python to Run all the Code and Scripts of this paper.

### How to use the code:

* Fortran90:
  * To compile, open the terminal at the route of the .f90 and write:
  ```sh
  gfortran Name.f90 randomgenerator.f90 -o Name.exe
  ```
  In our work: gfortran bonabeau_extended.f90 dranxor.f90 -o b.exe
  * To execute, open the terminal at the route of the .exe and write:
  ```sh
  name.exe
  ```
  In our work: b.exe  
* GnuPlot: to generate almost all the Figures, run the scripts on the same routes you will have the generated files.dat of the previous command in Fortran 90.
  ```sh
  gnuplot name.gnu
  ```
  Example: gnuplot thermalizationfitness.gnu
